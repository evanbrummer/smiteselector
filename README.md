# Smite God Selector (9.8)

Randomly selects a god to play by choosing a random row and column from the god menu. *Now including Ishtar!*

### To run this, you need the JDK

Available at: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-windows.

Without this, 'run.bat' will not work (```'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.```)
