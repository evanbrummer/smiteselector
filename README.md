# Smite God Selector (9.10)

Randomly selects a god to play by choosing a random row and column from the god menu. *Now including Maui!*

### To run this, you need the JDK

If 'run.bat' says ```'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.```, then you do not have the Java Development Kit installed. JDK 18 is available at: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-windows.
